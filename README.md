1. [ev-camper-electric-scheme.drawio](https://github.com/diviatrix/electric-vehicle-schemes/blob/main/ev-rv-vehicle/ev-camper-electric-scheme.drawio) (open with draw.io)
2. Scheme is for "top level" electrics, yet it can show you what to get and how to connect it.
3. My camper is based on chinese 4wheeler "golf-car". I removed original top fully, and wielded new body.
4. Scheme is suitable for any 48v vehicle of type, but you can easily modify it.
5. Full scheme probably will come sometime, with list of devices
